By default, card decks require two wrapping\n                                    elements: <code>.card-deck-wrapper</code> and a <code>.card-deck</code>.\n                                    We use table styles for the sizing and the gutters on <code>.card-deck</code>.\n                                    The <code>.card-deck-wrapper</code> is used to negative margin out\n                                    the border-spacing on the <code>.card-deck</code>.</p>\n                                <p>ProTip! If you enable flexbox mode, you can remove the <code>.card-deck-wrapper</code>.</p>\n                                <div className=\"card-deck-wrapper\">\n                                    <div className=\"card-deck\">\n                                        <div className=\"card\">\n                                            <img className=\"card-img-top width-full\" src=\"http://localhost/remark-react/global/photos/focus-1-480x320.jpg\" alt=\"Card image cap\" />\n                                            <div className=\"card-block\">\n                                                <h4 className=\"card-title\">Card title</h4>\n                                                <p className=\"card-text\">This is a longer card with supporting text below as a natural\n                                                    lead-in to additional content.
